Liri App for grabbing music/videos


There are 4 commands to use:

'spotify-this-song' - entering this command in the terminal will prompt you with a question regarding which song you would like to hear. After you respond to the question, liri will find the data for you surrounding your musical entry.

'concert-this' - currently entering this command in the terminal only brings back brackets... I know... it's frustrating for me as well. I believe there is something wrong with the URL but i ran out of time investigating before the assignment is over.

'movie-this; - entering this command in the terminal will prompt you with a question regarding which movie you would like know about. Liri will then find the data for you surrounding your movie query. 

'do-what-it-says' entering this command will perform what ever command and query is entered into the random.txt file. if the query doesn't match, it should direct you to fix the txt file.
